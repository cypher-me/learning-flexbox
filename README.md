## FLEXBOX
This is a repository of what I did and got into my thick scull while i was learning CSS Grid. 

The root of the folder contains `index.html` and `index.css` which are the notes and code I wrote while learning.

`rev/` folder contains code that i wrote while revisiting flexbox at the end of the day.

`flex-proj/` contains the final project I undertook with pure html and css using purely flexbox.

The journey has been fun and informative.
I can now say I have a competitive understanding of Flexbox.
